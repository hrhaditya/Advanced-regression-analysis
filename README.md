Advanced Regression Analysis
🔍 Exploring Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge

This project demonstrates advanced regression modeling techniques to predict continuous outcomes using real-world datasets. It focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, multicollinearity handling, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE.
📌 Project Highlights

    ✅ Multiple Linear Regression with detailed diagnostics

    🧮 Regularization using Ridge and Lasso regression

    🧪 Train-test split and cross-validation

    🧠 Multicollinearity check using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

    📉 Residual plots, error metrics, and model comparison

🧰 Tech Stack

    Python

    Pandas, NumPy

    scikit-learn

    matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

📈 Key Concepts Covered

    Linear vs Regularized Regression

    Ridge vs Lasso Coefficient Shrinkage

    Cross-validation and model selection

    Feature importance and interpretation

    Diagnostic plotting (residuals, Q-Q, leverage)
